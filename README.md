# 🎵 MUSIC-RECOMMENDATION-SYSTEM

A music recommendation system that suggests songs based on user emotions using deep learning.

---

## 💡 Overview

This project uses facial emotion recognition (or optionally, text input) to detect the user's mood and recommend appropriate songs. The model is trained using a convolutional neural network (CNN) and integrated with a music dataset to match songs with emotional states like happy, sad, angry, etc.
